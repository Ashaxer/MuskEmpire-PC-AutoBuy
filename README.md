# Introducing project
At first, this project enables launching MuskEmpire bot on PC Browser by making browser use a modified web-app using an extention called Resource Override
Second, using a sloppy python script I wrote, we manage to check for the best possible purchase with highest profit value available to you, then make the purchase and collect your money every 30 seconds.
